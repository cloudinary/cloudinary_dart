## Key Features
Transform and optimize assets. Visit our documentation to learn more about [media optimization](https://cloudinary.com/documentation/media_optimization) and [transformations](https://cloudinary.com/documentation/image_transformations).

## Version Support
| SDK Version | Dart Version |
|-------------|--------------|
| 0.0.11      | > 1.0        | 

## Installation
To use this SDK, add cloudinary as a [dependency in your pubspec.yaml file](https://flutter.dev/platform-plugins/).

```yaml
dependencies:
  cloudinary_dart: ^0.0.11
```

## Usage
### Setup
The `Cloudinary` class is the main entry point for using the library. Your `cloud_name` is required to create an instance of this class. Your `api_key` and `api_secret` are also needed to perform secure API calls to Cloudinary (e.g., image and video uploads). Setting the configuration parameters can be done either programmatically using an appropriate constructor of the Cloudinary class or globally using an environment variable. You can find your account-specific configuration parameters in the **Dashboard** page of your [account console](https://cloudinary.com/console).

Here's an example of setting configuration parameters in your Dart application:

```dart
import 'package:cloudinary_dart/src/cloudinary.dart';

var cloudinary = Cloudinary.fromStringUrl('cloudinary://<your-api-key>:<your-api-secret>@<your-cloud-name>');
```

### Transform and Optimize Assets

Generate a Cloudinary URL using the `cloudinary.media` helper method and pass this to your image or video view:

For example, to generate a URL for an image called `sample`:

```dart
String url = cloudinary.image('sample.jpg').toString();
```

To add a transformation to the URL that resizes an image:

```dart
String url = (cloudinary.image('sample.jpg')
  ..transformation(Transformation()
    ..resize(Resize.crop()
      ..width(100)
      ..height(150))))
        .toString();
```
